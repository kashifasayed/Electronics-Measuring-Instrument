    <h3><li>A clamp meter is an electric test tool that combines a basic digital multimeter with a current sensor.</li><br />
<li>Clamps measure current. Probes measure voltage.</li><br /> <li>
  A current transformed inside the clamp meter senses the magnetic fluctuation and converts the value to an AC current reading. This type of measurement is convenient for measuring very high AC currents. Direct current, however, flows through conductors in a fixed polarity.
</li><br /> <li>
  A clamp meter can check AC or DC voltage use to test continuity and also can check the flow of electric current through an electric circuit.
</li><br /> <li>Can easily detect damage part, broken conductivity or excessive resistance in a circuit that is open circuit and discontinuity.
</li><br /> <li> Clamp is around TWO wires nothing is measured, the current in the neutral wire cancels out the current in the phase/ live wire.
</li><br /> <li>If the clamp is opened, value decreases even when the clamp is away from wire value decreases significant.
</li><br /> <li>The measured value slightly influenced by the position of the wire inside the clamp.

<center><h2>HOW DO CLAMP METER OPERATE?</h2></center>
<p>
  In general AC clamp meter operate on the principle of <strong class="bold">current transformation (CT)</strong> used to pick up magnetic flux generated<br /> as a result of current flowing through a conductor. Assuming a current flowing through a conductor to be the primary current,<br /> you can obtain a current proportional to the primary current by <strong class="bold">electromagnetic induction</strong> from the secondary winding of the<br /> transformer which is connected to a measuring circuit of the instrument. This permits you to take an AC current reading on the<br /> digital display (in the case of digital clamp meter) as illustrated by the block diagram.

<li>Determine if the current to be measured is an <strong class="bold">AC or DC.</strong>
</li><br /><li>Select a clamp accessory for your multimeter that is designed to measure<br /> that specific current or one that can measure both <strong class="bold"> AC and DC.</strong>
</li><br /> <li>Determine if the range of your multimeter or clamp accessory is high enough<br /> to measure it. If not, select an instrument equipped for higher range.
</li><br /> <li>To measure <strong class="bold"> AC CURRENT</strong> with a current output clamp, turn the dial to mA/A.

</center>
<p>
  A clamp meter is primarily built for measuring current (or amperage), while a multimeter typically measures voltage, resistance, continuity, and sometimes low current. Nowadays, some clamps also include the measuring abilities of basic multimeters,<br /> and, likewise, some test meters allow for the attachment of an amp clamp (such as the Fluke iflex).
Whereas clamp meters can measure high current, while multimeters have higher accuracy and better and better resolution.

  Therefore there used to be clamp meter vs multimeter difference, with a clamp primarily built to measure amperage<br /> and multimeter for voltage, resistance and establishing continuity, with less focus on current. Today,<br /> the line is blurred and a good model can be an electricians bosom buddy. Those requiring more accuracy<br /> would be better with a separate, high quality multimeter together with an amp clamp for heavier work.

<center><h2>Drawbacks or disadvantages of Clamp Meter</h2><br /></center>
<li>  A clamp meter is a current measuring tool with some voltage measuring abilities.</li><br />
<li>It measures to nearest 10th or 100th of a unit rather than in milliunits measured using DMM.<br /> Milliunits refer to millivotes, milliamps and milliohms.

<p>
  Buying a clamp meter not only requires looking at specifications, but also looking at
 features,<br /> function, and the overall value represented by meter design and the care taken in its production.
Reliability,<br /> especially under tough conditions, is more important than ever today. Flukes design engineers make a point<br /> of building these test tools not only electrically robust, mechanically as well. By the time Fluke clamp meters<br /> are ready to be tossed into tool cases, they've undergone a rigorous testing and evaluation program.
User safety<br /> should be primary consideration in choosing a clamp meter or any other piece of electrical test equipment.<br /> Fluke not only designs their clamp meter to the latest electrical standard, but each is independently tested and then listed<br /> by certified testing labs such as UL, CSA, VDE, etc. Only with these certifications can you be assured an electrical tester meets these new safety standards.
