<center><h2>Block Diagram of CRO</h2></center>
<p>
  Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) consists a set of blocks. Those are vertical amplifier, delay line, trigger circuit, time base generator, horizontal amplifier, Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) & power supply. The block diagram of CRO is shown in below figure.
</p>
<br /><br /> <img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\block_diagram_of_cro.jpg" alt="block diagram of cro"> <br /><br />
<p>
  The function of each block of CRO is mentioned below.
  <br /><li><strong>Vertical Amplifier</strong>: It amplifies the input signal, which is to be displayed on the screen of CRT.</li><br />
  <br /><li><strong>Delay Line</strong>: It provides some amount of delay to the signal, which is obtained at the output of vertical amplifier. This delayed signal is then applied to vertical deflection plates of CRT.
</li><br />
  <br /><li><strong>Trigger Circuit </strong>: It produces a triggering signal in order to synchronize both horizontal and vertical deflections of electron beam.</li><br />
  <br /><li><strong>Time base Generator</strong>: It produces a sawtooth signal, which is useful for horizontal deflection of electron beam.</li><br />
  <br /><li><strong>Horizontal Amplifier</strong>: It amplifies the sawtooth signal and then connects it to the horizontal deflection plates of CRT.</li><br />
  <br /><li><strong>Power supply</strong>: It produces both high and low voltages. The negative high voltage and positive low voltage are applied to CRT and other circuits respectively.</li><br />
  <br /><li><strong>Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)</strong>: It is the major important block of CRO and mainly consists of four parts. Those are electron gun, vertical deflection plates, horizontal deflection plates and fluorescent screen.</li><br />
  <br /><br />
</p>
<p>
  The electron beam, which is produced by an electron gun gets deflected in both vertical and horizontal directions by a pair of <strong class="bold"> vertical deflection plates and a pair of horizontal deflection plates</strong> respectively. Finally, the deflected beam will appear as a spot on the fluorescent screen.
In this way, CRO will display the applied input signal on the screen of CRT. So, we can analyse the signals in <strong class="bold">time domain</strong> by using CRO

<center><h2>Measurements by using CRO</h2></center>
<br /><img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\measuring amplitude.png" alt="measuring Amplitude, time"><br /><br />
<p>
  We can do the following measurements by using CRO.
  <br /><li>Measurement of Amplitude</li><br />
  <br /><li>Measurement of Time Period</li><br />
  <br /><li>Measurement of Frequency</li><br />
</p>
<h2>Measurement of Amplitude</h2>
<p>
  CRO displays the voltage signal as a function of time on its screen. The amplitude of that voltage signal is <strong class="bold">constant</strong>, but we can vary the number of divisions that cover the voltage signal in vertical direction by varying <strong class="bold"> volt/division knob</strong> on the CRO panel. Therefore, we will get the amplitude of the signal, which is present on the screen of CRO by using following formula.
  <br /><br />
 A = j×nv<br /><br />
 Where,<br /><br />
 <strong>A</strong> is the amplitude<br /><br>
 <strong>j</strong>  is the value of volt/division<br /><br>
 <strong>nv</strong> is the number of divisions that cover the signal in vertical direction.<br /><br>
</p>
<h2>Measurement of Time Period</h2>
<p>
  CRO displays the voltage signal as a function of time on its screen. The Time period of that periodic voltage signal is constant, but we can vary the number of divisions that cover <strong class="bold"> one complete cycle of voltage</strong> signal in horizontal direction by varying time/division knob on the CRO panel.
Therefore, we will get the Time period of the signal, which is present on the screen of CRO by using following formula.
<br /><br>
T = k×nh <br><br>
Where,<br><br>
<strong>T</strong> is the Time period<br><br />
<strong>k</strong> is the value of time/division<br><br>
<strong>nh</strong> is the number of divisions that cover one complete cycle of the periodic signal in horizontal direction.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Measurement of Frequency</h2>
<p>
  The frequency, f of a periodic signal is the <strong class="bold">reciprocal of time period</strong>, T. Mathematically, it can be represented as<br /><br />
  f = 1/T<br /><br>
  So, we can find the frequency, f of a periodic signal by following these two steps.
  <br /><li><strong>Step 1</strong>:Find the Time period of periodic signal</li>
  <br /><li><strong>Step 2</strong>:Take <strong>reciprocal</strong> of Time period of periodic signal, which is obtained in Step1</li>

  Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO), which is a basic oscilloscope. We will get special purpose oscilloscopes just by including few additional blocks to the basic oscilloscope based on the requirement.
  <br /><br />Following are the <strong>special purpose oscilloscopes.</strong><br />
<li> Dual Beam Oscilloscope</li><br />
<li> Dual Trace Oscilloscope</li><br />
<li> Digital Storage Oscilloscope</li><br />
</p><br /><br />
<center><h2>Dual Beam Oscilloscope</h2></center>
<p>
  The Oscilloscope, which displays <strong>two voltage waveforms</strong> is called Dual Beam Oscilloscope. Its block diagram is shown in below figure.<br /><br />
</p>
<img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\dual_ beam_oscilloscope.jpg" alt="block diagram of dual beam oscillocope"><br />
<p>
  As shown in above figure, the CRT of Dual Beam Oscilloscope consists of <strong class="bold">two sets of vertical deflection plates</strong> and one set of <strong class="bold">horizontal deflection plates.</strong><br /><br />
  The combination of the following blocks together is called a <strong class="bold">channel.</strong>
  <br /><li>Pre-Amplifier & Attenuator</li><br />
  <br /><li>Delay Line</li><br />
  <br /><li>Vertical Amplifier</li><br />
  <br /><li>A set of Vertical Deflection Plates</li><br />
</p>
<p>
  There are two channels in Dual Beam Oscilloscope. So, we can apply the two signals, namely A & B as input of channel A & Channel B respectively. We can choose any one of these four signals as <strong class="bold">trigger input</strong> to the trigger circuit by using a switch.<br /><br />
  This oscilloscope will produce two vertically deflected beams, since there are two pairs of vertical deflection plates. In this oscilloscope, the blocks which are useful for deflecting the beam in horizontal direction is common for both the input signals. Finally, this oscilloscope will produce the <strong class="bold">two input signalss</strong> simultaneously on the screen of CRT.
</p>
<center><h2>Dual Trace Oscilloscope</h2></center>
<p>
  The Oscilloscope, which produces <strong class="bold">two traces on its screen</strong> is called Dual Trace Oscilloscope. Its block diagram is shown in below figure.
</p><br />
<img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\dual_trace_oscilloscope.jpg" alt="block diagram of dual trace oscillocope"><br /><br.>
<p>
  As shown in above figure, the CRT of Dual Trace Oscilloscope consists of a set of vertical deflection plates and another set of horizontal deflection plates. channel consists of four blocks, i.e. <strong class="bold">pre-Amplifier & attenuator, delay line,</strong> vertical amplifier and vertical deflection plates.<br /><br />
  n above block diagram, the first two blocks are separately present in both channels. The last two blocks are common to both the channels. Hence, with the help of <strong class="bold">electronic switch</strong> we can connect the delay line output of a specific channel to vertical amplifier.<br /><br />
  We can choose any one of these four signals as trigger input to the <strong class="bold">trigger circuit</strong> by using a switch. Those are input signals A & B, External signal (Ext) and Line input.<br /><br />
  This oscilloscope uses same electron beam for deflecting the input signals A & B in vertical direction by using an electronic switch, and produces <strong class="bold">two traces</strong>. the blocks that deflect the beam horizontally is common for both the input signals.
</p>
<center><h2>Digital Storage Oscilloscope</h2></center>
<p>
  The oscilloscope, which stores the waveform digitally is known as digital storage oscilloscope. The block diagram of (digital) storage oscilloscope is below.
</p><br />
<img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\digital_storage_oscilloscope.jpg" alt="block diagram of digital storage oscillocope"><br /><br />
<p>
  Additional blocks required for digital data storage are added to a basic oscilloscope to make it convert it into a Digital Storage Oscilloscope. The blocks that are required for <strong class="bold">storing of digital data</strong> are lies between the pre-amplifier & attenuator and vertical amplifier in Digital Storage Oscilloscope. Those are Sample and Hold circuit, Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), Memory & Digital to Analog Converter.<br /><br />
 <strong class="bold">Control logic</strong> controls the first three blocks by sending various control signals. The blocks like control logic and Digital to Analog Converter are present between the trigger circuit and horizontal amplifier in Digital Storage Oscilloscope.<br /><br />
The Digital Storage Oscilloscope <strong class="bold">stores the data</strong> in digital before it displays the waveform on the screen. Whereas, the basic oscilloscope doesn’t have this feature.
