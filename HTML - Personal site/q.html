<p>
  A device that is used to measure the <strong class="bold">QF</strong> (quality factor) or <strong class="bold">storage factor</strong> or <strong class="bold"> quality factor</strong> of the circuit at radio frequencies is called the Q-meter. In the oscillatory system, the QF is one of the essential parameters, used to illustrate the relationships among the dissipated & stored energies.

<p>
  By using Q value, the overall efficiency can be evaluated for the <strong class="bold">capacitors</strong> as well as coils used in RF applications. The principle of this meter mainly depends on series resonance because the voltage drop is Q times than the applied voltage across the capacitor otherwise coil. When the fixed voltage is applied to an electric circuit, a <strong class="bold">voltmeter</strong> is used to adjust the capacitor’s Q value to read directly.<br /><br />
  The total efficiency of capacitors & coils used for RF applications can be calculated with the help of Q value.<br /><br />
  At resonance<br /><br> <strong class="equation">Xl= Xc and<br /><br /> El= IXl,<br /><br> Ec = IXc,<br /><br> E = I R<br /></strong><br />
Where <strong>'E'</strong> is an applied voltage<br /><br />
<strong>‘Ec’</strong> is the capacitor voltage<br /><br / />
<strong>‘El’</strong> is an inductive voltage<br /><br />
<strong>‘Xl’</strong> is the inductive reactance<br /><br />
<strong>‘Xc’</strong> is the capacitive reactance <br><br>
<strong>‘R’</strong> is the coil resistance <br><br>
<strong>‘I’</strong> is circuit current <br><br>
Thus,<strong class="equation"> Q = Xl/R= Xc/R=Ec/E</strong><br /><br />
From the above ‘Q‘equation, if an applied voltage is kept stable so that the voltage across <strong class="bold">the capacitor</strong> can be calculated using a voltmeter to read ‘Q’ values directly.

        Q meter was developed by <strong>William D. Loughlin at Boonton Radio Corporation in the year 1934 in Boonton, New Jersey</strong>. The Q-meter instrument has become more popular in RF impedance measurement. There are different kinds of instruments available based on system usage. These are separated into two types like low-impedance injection & high-impedance injection. This device plays a key role in testing the RF circuits and also replaced in laboratories with other impedance measuring devices, although it is still in use among radio amateurs. This article discusses an overview of the Q meter.

<h2>Q Meter Circuit</h2>
<p>
  The circuit diagram of the ‘Q’ meter is shown below. It is designed with an oscillator that uses the frequency that ranges from 50 kHz – 50 MHz. and provides current to a shunt resistance ‘Rsh’with 0.02 ohms value.
  Here thermocouple meter is used to calculate the voltage across the shunt resistance whereas an electronic voltmeter is used to calculate the voltage across the capacitor. These meters can be calibrated to read ‘Q’ directly.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
  <strong class="equation">1). What is a quality factor?<br /><br /></strong>
The quality factor is a ratio of the stored power and dissipated power in an element.
<br><br>
<strong class="equation">2). What is ‘Q’ meter?</strong>
<br><br>
Q meter is one kind of instrument, used to measure electrical properties of coils & capacitors. This instrument is also used in laboratories.
<br><br>
<strong class="equation">3). What is the Q meter working principle?</strong>
<br><br>
The working principle of this meter is a series resonance
<br><br>
<strong class="equation">4). A practical Q meter includes of</strong>
<br><br>
It includes an RF oscillator
<br><br>
<strong class="equation">5). What is the Q factor of a series resonant circuit?</strong>
<br><br>
The Q factor of a series resonant circuit is Q = XL/R = XC/R
Thus, this is all about an overview of Q-Meter or RLC meter. As the name suggests, this instrument is used for calculating the Q-factor of the inductors & self-capacitance of the coil.
