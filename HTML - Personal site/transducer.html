  Basically, Transducer converts <strong class="bold">one form of energy into another form of energy</strong>. The transducer, which converts non-electrical form of energy into electrical form of energy is known as <strong class="bold">electrical transducer</strong>. The block diagram of electrical transducer is shown in below figure.<br /><br />

    As shown in the figure, electrical transducer will produce an output, which has electrical energy. The output of electrical transducer is equivalent to the input, which has non-electrical energy.

  <h2>Types of Electrical Transducers</h2>
  <p>
  Mainly, the electrical transducers can be classified into the following two types.
  <br /><li>Active Transducers</li><br />
  <br /><li>Passive Transducers</li><br />
  </p>
    <hr size="4" />
    <center><h2>Active Transducer</h2></center>
    <p>
    The transducer, which can produce one of the electrical quantities such as voltage and current is known as active transducer. It is also called <strong class="bold">self-generating transducer</strong>, since it doesn’t require any external power supply. <br />
    The block diagram of active transducer is shown in below figure.

<p>
  Active transducer is a transducer, which converts the non-electrical quantity into an electrical quantity. Let us consider the non-electrical quantities such as pressure, illumination of light and temperature. Hence, we will get the following two active transducers depending on the non-electrical quantity that we choose.
  <br /><li>Piezo Electric Transducer</li><br />
  <br /><li>Photo Electric Transducer</li><br />
  </p><br /><br />
  <h2>Piezo Electric Transducer</h2>
  <p>
    An active transducer is said to be piezo electric transducer, when it produces an electrical quantity which is equivalent to the pressure input.<br /><br />
    The piezo-electric effect exhibited by these three substances is Tourmaline, Quartz, and Rochelle salts, in this ascending order. The ascending order of mechanical strength having by these three substances is<strong class="bold"> Rochelle salts, Quartz, Tourmaline</strong>.<br /><br />
 Quartz is used as piezo electric transducer, as it exhibits the moderate piezo electric effect and having moderate mechanical strength among those three piezo electric substances.
    </p>
  <p><strong>Quartz Transducer</strong></p>
<p>
  The circuit diagram of Quartz transducer is shown in below figure. As shown in the figure, quartz crystal is placed between base and force summing member. The output voltage can be measured across the metal electrodes, which are placed on two sides of quartz crystal<br /><br />

  <p>
    The output voltage, V0 of above pressure transducer will be<br /><br />
    <strong> V0 = Q/C</strong>
    </p>
    <h2 class="back">Photo Electric Transducer</h2>
    <p>
      An active transducer is said to be photo electric transducer, when it produces an electrical quantity which is equivalent to the illumination of light input. The circuit diagram of photo electric transducer is shown in below figure.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\photo_electric_transducer.jpg" alt="circuit_diagram_of_photo_electric_transducer"><<br><br>
      <p>The working of photo electric transducer is mentioned below.<br>
      <br><li><strong>Step1</strong>- The photo electric transducer releases electrons, when the light falls on cathode of it.</li><br />
    <li><strong>Step2</strong>- The photo electric transducer produces a current, I in the circuit due to the attraction of electrons towards anode.</li><br />
  </p>

  <center><h2>Passive Transducers</h2></center>
  <p>
    he transducer, which can’t produce the electrical quantities such as voltage and current is known as passive transducer. But, it produces the variation in one of passive elements like resistor (R), inductor (L) and capacitor (C). Passive transducer requires external power supply.<br /><br />
    The block diagram of passive transducer is shown in below figure.
    </p>
    <img src="C:\Users\kasha.LAPTOP-72GSVFI6\Desktop\web development\HTML - Personal site\passive_transducer.jpg" alt="block diagram of passive transducer"><br /><br />
    <p>As shown in the figure, passive transducer will produce variation in the passive element in accordance with the variation in the non-electrical input quantity (or signal).
      Following are the examples of passive transducers.<br />
      <li>Resistive Transducer</li><br />
      <li>Inductive Transducer</li><br />
      <li>Capacitive Transducer</li><br />
